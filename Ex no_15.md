# EX 15 C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.

## Algorithm
1.Start.

2.Declare a array size value of type int.

3.Prompt the user to enter a value.

4.Read the value using scanf.

5.Initialize array elements.

6.Replace all even elements to E

7.End.
## Program:
```#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 int arr[100], n;
 scanf("%d", &n);
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
 }
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 if (arr[i] % 2 == 0)
 printf("E ");
 else
 printf("%d ", arr[i]);
 }
 printf("\n");
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:
<img width="464" height="177" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc7ea41-c4c8-465a-8fba-db3204be440f" />

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
